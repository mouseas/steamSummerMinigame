# Steam Summer 2015 Monster Minigame AutoScript #

## Purpose ##

This javascript automatically plays the 2015 Steam Summer minigame for you in a semi-optimal way.

It goes beyond the autoclicker scripts already out there. It will keep you in the lane where you'll make the most money, activate abilities as they are available and best apply, and possibly purchase upgrades and
powerups for you.

## Features ##

- Moves you to the lane most likely to give you gold, prioritized like so:
	1. The lane with a Treasure Minion or Boss
	2. The lane with the Miniboss with the lowest health
	3. The lane with a Spawner below 40% health
	4. The lane with a Creep below 10% health
	5. The lane with the Spawner with the lowest health
- Activates most reusable abilities, if they are purchased and cooled down:
	- Medics if your health is below 50%
	- Morale Booster, Napalm, and Cluster Bombs if the lane has a Spawner and 2-3 Creeps
	- Good Luck Charm as soon as possible
	- Tactical Nuke if the current Spawner is between 60% and 30% health
	- Metal Detector is facing a Boss who has less than 30% health
- Activates some items if you have them and the situation calls for them:
	- God Mode if Medics is in cooldown and your health is low
	- Cripple Spawner if the spawner in the current lane has more than 95% health
	- Gold Rain if facing a Boss who has more than 60% health
- Respawns you after 5 seconds (instead of 1 minute) if you die
- Disables certain abilities and items if facing a Boss (to try to maximize Raining Gold and Metal Detector benefits)
- Auto-clicks if the current lane has Raining Gold active
- Adds UI elements to adjust some settings

The game should now play itself, you should leave it running in the background. If you're not sure if it is auto-playing, try changing lanes. If it jumps back almost immediately, it's working.

## Update to 2.0 (Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey only) ##
If you have been redirected here, it means you are on an outdated version of the script that we cannot automatically update for you due to GM / TM limitations. To update the script, simply delete your version of the script from GM / TM, and follow the installation instructions above as you did the first time.

Thank you!

## I want to contribute! ##

This project is open-source on github. There are different ways you can help:

- Find a Pull Request that's marked `needs testing`. Run that version of the script for a while and watch the console for errors. If there's no errors, pay attention to what the changes are doing gameplay-wise, and make sure it's doing what it's supposed to do.
- Find an Issue that's marked `help wanted`. Make the changes needed by that issue, and create a Pull Request with your enhancement or bugfix.
- Pick an item off the TODO list, below, and implement it. When it's done (and tested and working), create a Pull Request.
- Got an idea for an improvement that's not already listed? Code it up, test it out, then make a Pull Request when it's ready.

### TODO ###

- Use abilities if available and a suitable target exists:
	 - Decrease Cooldowns right before using another long-cooldown item. (Decrease Cooldown affects abilities triggered while it is active, not right before it's used)
	 - Steal Health item if Medics is in cooldown and health is low. This should happen before using God Mode, and God Mode shouldn't be used if Steal Health is active.
- purchase abilities and upgrades intelligently
- automatically update the manual script by periodically checking https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mouseas/steamSummerMinigame/master/main.user.js
- add some buttons on the page for enabling/disabling certain features
